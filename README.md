# Blazor File Indexer -  [WebTails](https://github.com/ostr1969/dwgTextReader/tree/master/src/webtail)

This is a **Blazor Server** application that allows you to:

- Select folders on your system  
- Index **DWG**, **PDF**, and **text** files  
- Search the indexed files and see results with **highlighted words**  
- Manage a predefined list of words in `appsettings.json`  

The project uses [ACadSharp](https://github.com/DomCR/ACadSharp) for DWG file parsing.
